<p>  I'm interested in becoming a Data Analyst because I enjoy working with data to solve problems and uncover insights that can help businesses make informed decisions. I have a strong foundation in SQL, Excel, and data visualization tools, and I find it fulfilling to turn raw data into clear, actionable information.

What excites me most about the role is the opportunity to combine technical skills with business thinking — exploring trends, identifying patterns, and telling stories through data. I'm naturally curious and detail-oriented, and I like asking questions like: “What’s driving this change?” or “How can we improve this process?”

Given my background in IT support and teaching, I also bring strong communication skills, which I believe are essential for explaining data insights to both technical and non-technical teams.

Ultimately, I see data analytics as a career where I can make a meaningful impact by helping organizations make smarter, data-driven decisions   </p>
